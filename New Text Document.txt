I created a Company Packing List webpage using HTML & CSS, featuring:
✅ A fixed navigation bar with an active menu highlight
✅ A styled search section for filtering table data
✅ A well-structured table displaying shipment details
✅ Custom styling with responsive design for a clean UI

This project helped me enhance my CSS layout skills, improve table structuring, and apply best practices for web accessibility and responsiveness.
